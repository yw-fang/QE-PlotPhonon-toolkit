## QE-PlotPhonon-toolkit

This is my personal fork of PlotPhon based on it's repleased version in the Quantum Espresso 5.4.0.

In the QE v.6, this package may not be supported.

In the example folder, in addition to some PlotPhonon examples, I also present some phonon calculation examples with the PBS Professional. All these examples have been tested on the fourth generation cluster (sugon) in the East China Normal University supercomputering center.
