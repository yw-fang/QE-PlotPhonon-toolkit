There are several ways to plot phonon band dispersions except the
plotband.x in QE.

Here, I mentioned several others:

1. If you want to use the k-point generated by the 
internal k_for_bands.x in QE, however, it doesn't support all the
crystal structures. Only simple structures such as FCC, simple tetragonal... are considered. Be cautious, there may be errors.

In this case,  you should prepare a K_points file.

Then, just run

run_Plot_Phonons-LWN.sh

to generate the phonon bands.


2. In the second method, I use the KPOINTS generated by genbandk-pwscf. I used this method during my PhD program in ECNU. It's nice, but the fortran program is not modern and sometimes gives errors in some computers

3.  In the third way I prefer, the kpoints were generated by vasp-phonopy. I mananually genereate LWN.525.freq (../phonon-calculation-example/BiBaTi2O6-Comet/), and then just use run_Plot_Phonons-LWN-specifyK.sh to generate the pdf files.

4. If you can install pwtools, you can also use it to plot

5. I also wrote some draft codes to plot bands, but it has not developped, which you can find in ./bandplot-2018
