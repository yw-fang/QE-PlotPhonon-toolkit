## QE-PlotPhonon-toolkit

This is my personal fork of PlotPhon based on it's repleased version in the Quantum Espresso 5.4.0.

This code may not supported to post-process the results generated by higher versions of Quantum Espresso.

In the Example folder, in addition to some PlotPhonon examples, I also present some phonon calculation examples with the PBS or SLURM job system.  These examples have been tested on the fourth generation cluster (sugon) at East China Normal University supercomputering center and XSEDE-Comet.
